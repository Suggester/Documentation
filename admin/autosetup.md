# Command: autosetup
---
### Description
This command allows admins to automatically setup the bot in their server, by creating useful channels in the server:

**Suggester will create 4 channels and 1 category in your server:**
- The first channel will host [approved suggestions](/config/suggestions.md), any idea you choose to approve will be posted there for people to vote on.
- The second one will be used for [denied suggestions](/config/denied.md): bad ideas, spam, people begging for free cookies or whatever, all suggestions you decide to deny will be sent there (unless you prefer them to stay in the dark by [silent-denying](/staff/silentdeny.md) them ðŸ‘€).
- The third one is the coolest because it will be used to choose a stance on new suggestions, you'll be able to approve or deny them and optionally add a comment.
- Lastly, a new channel will be created to have eyes on everything. Well, at least what Suggester does in your server, read more about suggestion logs [here](/config/logs.md). 

- Last but not least, a tasty category named "Suggester" will be created and all of the above will be added into it.

?> If you are looking for more granular options, take a look at the [config](/config/configuration.md) command.

?> If you have configured a server-wide [language](/config/locale.md), the names of the created channels will be set accordingly. If they still appear in English, it means the corresponding strings have not yet been translated.
