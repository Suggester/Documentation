# Official Suggester Documentation {docsify-ignore-all}
---

All sections in these docs will use the bot's default prefix, which is currently `.` (yes, that's a dot). You can change it at anytime using the [config](/config/configuration.md) command, and more precisely by redefining the [Prefix](/config/prefix.md) element.

In this documentation, arguments surrounded by `[square brackets]` are __required__ and arguments surrounded by `(parenthesis)` are __optional__.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us in our [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support)! Don't worry, we don't bite :)
