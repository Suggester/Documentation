    R.I.P Suggester (2019-2025)
  </h1>

 <p>Hello everyone,</p>

  <p>As you may have noticed, Suggester has not been online for a while now. Sadly, we've taken the difficult decision to <strong>shut it down permanently</strong>.</p>

  <p>Over the years, its codebase slowly became outdated, making it increasingly time-consuming to keep it up to date with the latest Discord features, like threads, or more importantly slash commands and everything that came with it. On top of that, the lives of the two developers behind the bot got more and more busy, making it even more difficult to keep it working. To our surprise, it has survived quite a long time without real maintenance, only running on manual restarts every two to three days.</p>

  <p>This also means <strong>Threaded</strong> has stopped operating, because while it was still working without issues, it doesn't really have a purpose if Suggester isn't online.</p>

  <p>For those of you that purchased a custom instance of Suggester, we will keep it running for some time, but new instances are no longer available for purchase.</p>
