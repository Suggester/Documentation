# Official Suggester Documentation
---

All sections in these docs will use the bot's default prefix, which is currently `.` (yes, that's a dot). You can change it at anytime using the [config](/config/configuration.md) command, and more precisely by redefining the [Prefix](/config/prefix.md) element.

In this documentation, arguments surrounded by `[square brackets]` are __required__ and arguments surrounded by `(parenthesis)` are __optional__. List of arguments separated by slashes (`/`) denote the possible sub-arguments for a specific command, note that you can only **pick one at a time**.

To prevent spam and uphold general good practices, commands can **only** be used by users.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us in our [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support)! Don't worry, we don't bite :)
