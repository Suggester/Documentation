### Donations

If you are looking for a way to support and help keep the costs down for Suggester, you can make a one-time donation or purchase a tier on our [donation page](https://ko-fi.com/suggester)! Our one-time donators will also obtain a fancy purple Donator role in the [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support).

### Custom Instances
If you are looking for an extra layer of customization, we got you covered! For a monthly price varying based on the number of servers you'd like to use it in, we'll host a special instance of Suggester tailored to your liking. We currently provide **4** customization options: username, avatar, banner and bio.
