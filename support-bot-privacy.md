# Support Privacy Policy
**Effective Date:** Feburary 14th, 2022

Support (also referred to as "the support bot", "it" or `Support#8828`) is a Discord bot that makes use of [threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423) to provide a smooth support experience to users. It is used in Suggester's official [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support) and has been since August 2021 to provide a high-quality system to handle user concerns, questions and feedback.

## Data Handling & Logging
While it does not store data coming from the API, it does rely on logging actions for analytical and debugging purposes. The term "actions" mostly represents interactions with the bot that result in responses. Logged content contains basic information about your profile (username and discriminator) and a brief description of what you did (for example, opened a support ticket). Due to the nature of this logging system, fully integrated with Discord, we are not able to delete them.
At this time, only the bot owner (`Suspense#4615`) has access to the logged data.

## Questions
If you have any questions about the bot, please join the [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support) and open a ticket in the `#support` channel.
