# Support: Privacy Policy

## Intro
Support (also referred to as "the support bot", "it" or `Support#8828`) is a Discord bot that makes use of [threads](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423) to provide a smooth support experience to users. It is used in Suggester's official [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support) since August 2021 and delivers a high-quality system to handle user concerns, questions or feedback.

## Data Processing
Support does not store user data, but our system uses logging to analyze and debug interactions with the bot. These "actions" include any user input that prompts a response, like using a command for example. The logged information includes your profile's basic details (username, discriminator and id) and a brief description of the action you took (e.g. opening a support ticket). Unfortunately, because our logging system is fully integrated with Discord, we cannot delete these records. Only Suggester Staff members have access to the logs.
