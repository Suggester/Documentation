#### **Documentation Translations**

# Documentation Translations
---
If you are interested in helping translate Suggester's documentation, you will need to be a part of our translation team! If you are not yet part of the translation team, hit us up in our [support server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp) and we'll get you started!
More info can be found [here](https://canary.discordapp.com/channels/566002482166104066/700726254239744102/700728780032835646)! Otherwise, send any `Staff Member` a DM saying that you're interested in helping translate the documentation so we can get everything ready for you and get you started. We will be doing translations through GitHub, so having a basic understanding of how [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) and/or [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github) work would definitely be in your best interest.

If, at any point in the translation process, you have any questions, feel free to send a `Staff Member` a DM and we will be happy to assist you.

Otherwise, send any Staff Member a DM saying that you're interested in helping translate the bot so we can get everything ready for you and get you started! We will be doing translations through another bot that the Devs have designed to be able to help you translate the bot. If you know the langauge, can follow through a simple walk through, and follow directions, that would be best! 

If, at any point in the translation process, you have any questions, feel free to send any `Staff Member` a DM and we will be happy to assist you.
