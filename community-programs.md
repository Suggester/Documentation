### 🌐 Translating Suggester

Hallo! Bonjour! ¡Buenos dias! If you are interested in helping translate Suggester, you will need to be a part of our translation team! If you are not yet part of it, hit us up in our [support server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp) and we'll get you started!
When you're done accepting our party invite, head over to `#community-programs` where you'll find more information. Translations are handled using a super cool bot which provides an interactive way to translate everything. If you're fluent in the language, can understand the system and how it works, and have a basic understanding of english, you're suited for our Translation Team! 

### 🐛 Hunting Bugs

Do you want to test features before everyone? Well this program is for you! Canary members will get new versions of the bot before the public does to make sure they're 100% bug-free. All you need to do is to grab the shiny Canary role in our [support server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp) using `!join Canary` in the commands channel, yes this is that simple.
Once claimed, this role will give you access to a few super secret Canary testing channels! Make sure to read the pins in [`#canary-info`](https://canary.discord.com/channels/566002482166104066/618527254271754250) for important information. 
You might be wondering how to get the Canary bot (you do.. right?), well the bot is public and can be invited to any server once you are a Canary tester. When new features are released, we will mention the Canary role to notify everyone of the new build. If you're not using the bot/testing your server may be removed from the program.

### 📡 Large Guild Privileges

If your server has a large (as in, several thousands) number of members or a high volume of suggestions, it might be eligible for our Large Guild Privileges Program! Send us a request in our [support server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp) and we'll review your application as soon as possible! Servers in the program will receive enhancements for the `top` & `down` commands, larger imports and reduced cooldowns for server staff & admins.
