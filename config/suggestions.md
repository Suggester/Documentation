# Configuration Element: Approved Suggestions Feed

### Description
This element allows you to define a channel where suggestions will be sent once they've been approved, or directly upon submission if the mode is set to `autoapprove`. It is recommended to set up a channel that is only used for server suggestions, as it can quickly get messy if the channel is used for multiple purposes at once!

### Usage
Set up the suggestion feed using `.config suggestions [channel]`

### Aliases
`suggestionchannel` and `suggestionschannel`

### Accepted Inputs
Any channel name, ID or #mention


?> [Forum Channels](https://discord.com/blog/forum-channels-space-for-organized-conversation) are not currently supported and may not be configured as the suggestions feed channel.
