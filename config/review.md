# Configuration Element: Review Channel

### Description
This element allows you to choose the channel where suggestions will be sent after they've been submitted when the mode is set to `review` (surprising huh). From there, staff members can approve or deny the suggestion.

### Usage
Set up a review channel using `.config review [channel]`

### Accepted Inputs
Any channel name, id or #mention

?> [Forum Channels](https://discord.com/blog/forum-channels-space-for-organized-conversation) are not currently supported and may not be configured as the review channel.
