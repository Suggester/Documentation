# Configuration Element: Blocked Roles

### Description
Suggester bases its permission system the same as Discord, by using different roles. Blocked roles define what roles will be prevented from using the bot at all in the server. If you're trying to block a specific user, use the [`.block`](/staff/block.md) command instead.

### Usage
Set up blocked roles using `.config blocked add/remove/list [role]`

### Aliases
`blockedroles` and `blockrole`

### Accepted Inputs
Any role name, id or @mention

?> Members with staff or admin permissions will still be able to use the bot even if they have one or more blocked roles.
