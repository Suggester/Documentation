Discord just [released](https://discord.com/blog/slash-commands-permissions-discord-apps-bots) a huge revamp of the permission system for application commands! This means you now have more control on who can use application commands, and where. Check it out in **Server Settings â†’ Integrations**, then click on Suggester.
