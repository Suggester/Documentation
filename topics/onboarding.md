Suggester is the most configurable suggestion bot on Discord, with many settings that can be tailored to your server such as:

- Setting roles that can manage suggestions
- Allowing only certain roles to submit suggestions
- Cleaning suggestion commands
- Blocking roles from submitting suggestions
- Customizing voting emojis
- Allowing only certain roles to vote on suggestions
- Server language\
Additionally, we have a unique **review** mode that allows staff members to review suggestions before they are sent to the suggestions channel! This is the mode used by default, but we also offer the **autoapprove** mode which automatically sends suggestions to the approved channel.

Suggester also allows you to keep your server members updated via commenting and marking statuses!

> Suggester completely changed my way of keeping in touch with server members. Managing user suggestions and keeping them updated about what they truly care about has never been so streamlined! Comments and votes are the easiest way to turn the spotlight on for most wanted and high quality suggestions. Would 100% recommend.

> Suggester is the most advanced suggestion bot I've ever seen. At first when suggested I was doubtful but after trying it I couldn't go back! It works better than other bots which just think of suggestions as a side idea. But with Suggester, suggestions are the main focus and not just an afterthought. Suggester brings features I didn't know I needed to the table, while remaining simple and easy to use. Would highly recommend.

We support importing old suggestions into our bot that were sent from users as well as via bots such as CarlBot, Zira, UnbelievaBoat, and many more with the [`import`](admin/import.md) command!
