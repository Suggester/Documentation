# Suggester 2
### What is Suggester 2?
Suggester 2 is a secondary, pretty much identical, version of Suggester.

### What is it for?
Its main purpose is to allow server admins to operate an extra suggestion setup with different settings in the same server, something that is not currently supported within the main instance due to the complexity of supporting such feature.

### Similarities & Differences
The default prefix is a comma (`,`) but anyone with admin permissions can change it at any time using `,config prefix <new prefix>`. Its avatar, username and database are unique, which means suggestions and other data handled by the main Suggester or other instances will be unknown to Suggester 2, and vice versa.

!> Suggester 2 __might not be available__ when you try to add it due to not being verified. We often try to free up some slots by leaving servers where it isn't setup, isn't being used, or where the main Suggester is not present.
