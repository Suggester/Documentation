You can find below a list of issues we are aware of, alongside potential workarounds or more detailled information about the issue. This list was last updated on June 9th, 2025.

**Suggester does not work!**

Suggester is partially down, we are aware that it does not respond to commands, or is generally slow. Support tickets are open for the minority that can still use it. **There is no ETA on this being resolved**.

 **A suggestion I don't have access to prevents me from changing the mode**

This happens when the review message of a suggestion or the channel it was posted in is deleted when the suggestion is still pending. We recommend using managing commands **before** taking destructive actions such as deleting a channel. If you are in this situation, reach out to our support team with some context and relevant suggestion ids.
