# Editing a suggestion
Mistakes happen, when your grammar randomly decides to take a nap when suggesting something, you can now fix it using the shiny `.edit` command! 

### Users
Regular users can only edit their own approved suggestion(s). If the mode is set to [review](/config/mode.md), any edit will require approval by a staff member to be updated in the sugggestion feed. If the suggestion is edited by someone with staff or admin permissions, no approval is required.

### Staff & Admins
Users with staff or admin permissions can edit **any** suggestion, with no approval required. If the suggestion has been edited by a server staff member, it will be displayed alongside their username on the suggestion embed.

If the mode is set to [review](/config/mode.md), all editing requests from users with no elevated permissions will require approval to update the suggestion. To handle these editing requests, members with staff or admin permissions can use the [`approveedit`](/staff/approveedit.md) and [`denyedit`](/staff/denyedit.md) commands or simply click on the corresponding reactions on the message sent in the [review](config.review.md) channel.

### Usage
Use `.edit [suggestion ID] [new content]` in any channel the bot can read and send messages in.

### Arguments

`suggestion ID`: The ID of the suggestion you’d like to edit. If you don't have staff/admin perms, you can only edit your own suggestions.\
`new content`: The edited version of the suggestion.

!> Once you've edited a suggestion, you cannot restore its original content!
