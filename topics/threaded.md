# âœ¨ Threaded, an add-on to Suggester 
Threaded is an extension to Suggester that automatically creates threads on new approved suggestions.

## Configuration
To setup the bot, simply add "`[t]`" to the topic of your suggestion channel (Channel Settings > Channel Topic) and make sure it has the **Create Public Threads** permission in that same channel. Once you've done that, new threads will be created for each new suggestion! 

If you delete a suggestion, Threaded will automatically close and lock the thread if it has the **Manage Threads** permission in the channel.

If you're experiencing issues with the bot, you can use the `/troubleshoot` command to find the issue. If the problem persists, or you want to give feedback, feel free to hop in the [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support) and open a ticket, though make sure to mention that you're asking about Threaded!


## Add the bot
