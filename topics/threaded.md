## Configuration
To setup the bot, simply add `[t]` to the topic of your suggestion channel (Channel Settings > Channel Topic) and make sure it has the **Create Public Threads** permission in that same channel.
Once you've done that, new threads will be created for each new suggestion! 

If you're experiencing issues with the bot, you can use the `/info` command and click the Troubleshoot* button to get help, or you can join the [Suggester support server](https://suggester.js.org/support) and open a support ticket, make sure to mention you're asking about Threaded!


?> * The button might be named differently as the bot is available in several languages.
