# Privacy and Security Information
Suggester needs access to certain information in order to properly function and provide the services users expect. We have listed below all the information that we store alongside the reason we store it for. All data and bot services are protected by authentication, and access is limited to a small set of users (developers and Suggester Staff members). Additionally, we will never give out the information we store to unauthorized users. If you believe you have found a security issue in one of our systems, please **do not** post publicly. Contact us in our support server and we'll bring up the issue to the developers (Ben, aka `@index.ts` or Brightness, aka `@brightness`) with information so they can investigate. 

## What does Suggester store?
- **User IDs:** We store these to link suggestions to their author, so the bot can show the user who submitted the suggestion. They are also used to maintain a list of blocked users both on 
 a per-server basis and globally.
- **Channel IDs:** We store these so that the bot can know where to send various messages such as suggestion-awaiting-review messages, suggestion messages, denied suggestion messages, and log messages.
- **Role IDs:** We store these to allow server admins to configure roles that have certain permissions on the bot (staff, admin, blocked roles, etc.)
- **Server IDs:** We store these to keep server configurations and suggestions tied to their respective servers.
- **Webhook URLs:** We store these to ensure logging through webhooks works - only one URL is stored which is the URL of the webhook created by the bot when logging is configured.
- **Server Emotes:** We store server emote names/IDs if a server configures an emote as a reaction emote in the suggestion feed.
- **Submitted Suggestions & Comments:** We store message content submitted as suggestions and comments in order for the bot to have data about each suggestion.
- **Attachment URLs:** We store URLs of files attached to suggestions in order to make the attaching feature possible.\
We log **commands used and servers the bot is added to/removed from** for analytical purposes.
We store information pertaining to Trello boards connected to the bot and actions such as card creation and comments taken via the bot on those boards.

## Other
Bots that help to manage the Suggester Support server also store some information:\
**VoteBoat#1330**: Your user ID and the number of votes you have on each site\
**i18n#1614**: Content provided as translations for strings and your user ID for permission purposes\
**Suggester Support#5646**: DMs sent to the bot, your username, nickname (if any), account creation date and account age (only if/when you contact the bot by sending it a direct message)\
**Support#8828**: This one has its own document which you can find [here](https://suggester.js.org/#/support-bot-privacy).
**Threaded#5120**: This bot does not store any data, but logs thread creation including server name, server id and corresponding suggestion id. It is owned and managed by Suspense, @almostsuspense.

## Concerns
If you have any concerns about the data we store or the functions of the bot, please contact a member of the Suggester Staff Team via the [support server](https://suggester.js.org/support).
