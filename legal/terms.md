# Suggester Terms of Service
  
### What is Suggester
Suggester is a [Discord](https://discord.com) bot helping community staff members and admins to manage feedback in their server(s), using a modern suggestion system and its granular configuration elements.

### Definitions
You will find below a list of definitions explaining the meaning of specific words or group of words used throughout these terms:
- "the Services" refers to all of our official products listed under the "Products" section.
- "Termination" refers, in the context of a Discord server (or guild), to the removal of some or all of our Services from it, temporarily or permanently. In the context of a user, it refers to the suspension of the user's ability to use some or all of our Services. 
- "Your Content" refers to the content you share with our Services (such as when submitting a suggestion). This may include text, pictures, videos or documents of all types. If, at any time, we officially start providing support for another way for you to add content to the Services, it will be counted.

# Usage Requirements
## Age
Per Discord's own [terms](https://discord.com/terms), using the platform requires you to be at least 13 years old and above the minimum age of digital consent in your country. As such by using the Services, you confirm to meet both of the aforementioned requirements.

## Account & Responsibility
To use the Services, you will need to create or be the owner of a [Discord](https://discord.com) account. As outlined in Discord's own [terms](https://discord.com/terms), you will have to provide a username, a password, and a way to contact you (an email address or phone number). For more information about how Discord uses your data, check out their [privacy policy](https://discord.com/privacy). Additionally, you are responsible for the security of your account, and therefore we are not liable for any actions taken on the behalf of your account impacting your usage or that of other people of the Services, regardless of whether it is or has been compromised.

# Content Moderation & Regulation
## Accountability 
You are not obligated in any way to add content to the Services. However, if you choose to, you instantly and automatically become accountable for ensuring that you have the rights to do so, including ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We take no responsibility for any of your content, and we are not responsible for use of your content by other users or third parties.

## Acceptable Use
When using our Services, you must comply with these terms and all applicable laws, at all times, and within what we define as acceptable use. Do not try to, participate or encourage others to use the Services in any of the following ways:

- **Do not use the Services to harm anyone (yourself included)**: This also includes trying to gain access to other people’s account(s) or any restricted or private portions of the Services, infringing anyone else’s intellectual property rights or any other proprietary rights, harassing, bullying.

- **Do not use the Services to, or try to, harm Discord, us, or any other entity**: This includes trying to gain access to or attacking our systems (i.e. spamming), scraping us, transmitting viruses or other malicious code to our Services, abusing or defrauding us or our payment systems, copying our product or using our intellectual property without explicit written approval, and misusing our reporting or support mechanisms.

- **Do not use the Services to break the law anywhere in the world**: This includes using the Services to commit any crime or infringe on someone else's intellectual property rights.


# Your Legal Rights
### Right to Erasure
As outlined in the Articles 15 and 17 of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and in our [privacy policy](/legal/privacy.md), you can exercise your "right to be forgotten" (also known as "right to erasure"), and "right of access by the data subject" to request access or erasure of your data from our systems by [contacting us](https://suggester.js.org/support).

### Termination (initiated by you)
You are allowed to stop using any or all of the Services at any time and for any reason.

### Termination (initiated by us)
We reserve the right to temporarily or permanently suspend, terminate or interrupt your ability to use some or all of our Services, with or without notice, with or without a reason, at our discretion, including if:
- You breach these terms or applicable laws
- We are required to do so to comply with a legal requirement 
- We believe termination is necessary to prevent harm to you, us, other users, or third parties
- There has been no use of our Services on your server for a prolonged duration of time

### Update of these terms
We may decide to update these terms for a multitude of reasons, for example to prevent abuse of the Services. If these changes affect how you use the Services, we will notify you before they enter into effect, unless we deem the modification of this document urgent. Your continued use of the Services implies your agreement to the updated documents.
